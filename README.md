# Perceptron
The Perceptron Classifier is a linear algorithm that can
be applied to binary classification tasks. if some linear data
look non linear in a one-dimensional plane, but in a higher
dimensional plane, they will look linear and can be classified.
So, a φ function is introduced. The data are multiplied with
the φ function. Then the other class is normalized. the data
is multiplied with the learning rate then again multiplied with
the weight vector, if result is negative, weight is updated and
the same thing is done until a positive result is found, if the
result is positive, then the data is correctly classified.

The minimum distance to class mean
classifier works on unclassified data and classifies them
according to their distance from each class. If the
distance is nearer to class1, then it is classified to class2,
if the distance is nearer to class2 then it is classified to
class2. A decision boundary line is drawn to separate
the classes. From the experiment of the given test data,
the accuracy of the found 85.714%
