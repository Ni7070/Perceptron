# Perceptron
The Perceptron Classifier is a linear algorithm that can
be applied to binary classification tasks. if some linear data
look non linear in a one-dimensional plane, but in a higher
dimensional plane, they will look linear and can be classified.
So, a φ function is introduced. The data are multiplied with
the φ function. Then the other class is normalized. the data
is multiplied with the learning rate then again multiplied with
the weight vector, if result is negative, weight is updated and
the same thing is done until a positive result is found, if the
result is positive, then the data is correctly classified.
